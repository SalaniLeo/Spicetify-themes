    --adwaita - Installs Adwaita theme
    --nord    - Installs Nord theme
```

<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
With time I'll create more themes, but know that I create one when I get bored of the previous one or I change my desktop theme. <br>
I'm not that good in designing stuff, so I understand if you don't like these themes, <br>
also I made these only based on my preferences and for personal use.
