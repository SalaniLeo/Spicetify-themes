# Spicetify Themes
#### This is a collection of [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) themes I made
## Themes
 <ul>
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/SalaniLeo/Spicetify-themes/blob/main/Adwaita%20Theme/README.md">Adwaita</a>
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/SalaniLeo/Spicetify-themes/blob/main/Nord%20Theme/README.md">Nord</a> </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
With time I'll create more themes, but know that I create one when I get bored of the previous one or I change my desktop theme. <br>
I'm not that good in designing stuff, so I understand if you don't like these themes, <br>
also I made these only based on my preferences and for personal use.
